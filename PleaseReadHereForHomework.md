Hi Mike,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out to you in advance regarding my VBA assignment. Unfortunately, the past couple of weeks have been extremely busy for me at work, and I've found the VBA and Python tasks to be quite challenging.

As I  spent a lot of time reviewing the in-class activities, I realized that I haven't had enough time to complete my VBA assignment thoroughly. There are several bugs in the code that I'm unable to fix, and unfortunately, I haven't been able to secure a tutoring session to seek guidance.

I want to apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding. I managed to run the first half of the code with Pankaj, and it worked on the alphabet sheet. However, I encountered difficulties when attempting to run it on the Multiple_year_stock_data sheet. Regrettably, it even caused Excel to crash. Just to be cautious, I have attached all of my code below. I hope it works on your computer.

Once again, I apologize for any trouble this may cause, and I truly appreciate your support.

Best regards,
